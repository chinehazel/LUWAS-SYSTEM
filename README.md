# LUWAS-SYSTEM
LUWAS is a web-based healthcare platform developed for our CCC181 â€“ Application Development and Emerging Technologies (3E) course. The project focused on applying full-stack development principles, emphasizing hands-on experience in building dynamic web applications with integrated database systems. Through this project, we strengthened our technical proficiency in designing interactive interfaces, managing data flow between front-end and back-end components, and implementing responsive user experiences.

Key Features and Technical Highlights

- Telemedicine Module: Designed and integrated front-end components in React to simulate real-time video consultation functionality between patients and specialists.

- Database Management: Built and connected a MySQL database to handle user records, appointment data, and insurance details securely.

- Appointment and Form System: Developed interactive PHP-based forms with database connectivity for scheduling and information handling.

- Front-End Design: Implemented responsive and accessible web pages (Home, About Us, Contact, Blogs) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enhance user experience and navigation.
  
The website was not deployed, this project provided valuable experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, PHP, and MySQL, strengthening our understanding of both front-end and back-end web development.
